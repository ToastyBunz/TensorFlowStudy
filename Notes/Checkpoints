They are saves of the weights when training a model.
- partially trained weights
- fully trained weights

What are Checkpoint formatted files?
contain the trained weights in a binary formate.
- one or more shards that contain your model's weights
- and index file that indicates which weights s are stored in which shard. 



### Ways to save model
- SavedModel
- HDF5
  (HDF5 you can load them into TensorFlow.js then train and run them in web browsers or 
mobile with TensorFlow lite)
